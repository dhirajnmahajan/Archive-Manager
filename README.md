# ARCHIVE MANAGER
### A simple shell script project to archived the files ( files in specific directory) having size larger than 100 Mb.


## Working :
- In this project , first I added the path (a path in which we want to archived the files/folders ).
- After I added the command to make the files archived (for loop is used ) it checks all the files in that path which have larger size (the files will archived if their size is larger than 100 Mb) .
- Once a file is found then it will be archived with  .gz extension and move to that archive folder (I used mv command).




## Developement :
### Commands Used  -
- mkdir
- mv
- date

 ### Other Expression
  
  - (for each loop)
  - ( if then )
